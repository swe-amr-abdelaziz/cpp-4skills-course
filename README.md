- Follow best practices for using Git, with better commits and more organized branches
- Use Docker to generate image for C++ development and CI/CD pipeline <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/amrswe/cpp-utils" target="_blank">image link</a>
- Use Github Actions (CI/CD Pipeline), steps include:
    - Check naming conventions
    - Check code formatting
    - Static analysis with Cppcheck
    - Build project
    - Run unit tests
    - Run memory leak checks
